I am a student of Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering in Indian Institute of Information Technology Raichur, which is under the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad.

My home town is Ajmer, Rajasthan, and belongs to a lower-middle-class family. I learn a lot of things from my past, which motivates me to work hard to make a better future.
